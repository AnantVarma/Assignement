        <p>India became the first team to win the men's T20 World Cup without losing a game all tournament. India won all eight matches they played in the tournament, and had one washout: the first-round game against Canada.

          India's eight consecutive wins in completed games is the joint-longest winning streak for any team in the men's T20 World Cup. Australia won eight successive games across the 2022 and 2024 editions, while South Africa was on an eight-match winning streak before Saturday's defeat.
          Even before the match had begun, the streets around the Kensington Oval were awash with blue. There were neutrals, there was the rare South African, but the overwhelming majority of fans were here hoping to see Rohit Sharma lift the trophy they felt was theirs by divine right, unaware it would be the last time he would represent India in this format.

        The first time when he wore a winner’s medal he was a rookie in South Africa in 2007. He bowed out wearing one in Barbados as the leader of an incredibly talented and defiant India side that beat South Africa – the symmetry complete and the weight of expectation of more than one billion Indian fans lifted off his shoulders.

          The picture of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in tears was the perfect representation of how the Indian cricket team and their fans felt after the loss against Australia in the ODI World Cup 2023 final. While both players won World Cups as youngsters in the national set-up, the loss robbed them to the perfect chance to bookend their illustrious careers. However, there was no such case on Saturday as India defeated South Africa in a thriller to clinch the T20 World Cup 2024 title and the excitement was visible on the experienced duo's faces. Rohit broke down in tears on the ground while Virat's fist bumps and aggressive celebration once again provided a sneak peek at his competitive attitude. However, what made the victory bittersweet was the dual announcement that shook Indian cricket.
          Just after the match, Kohli was asked by presenter Harsha Bhogle about his future and the star batter announced that it was his final T20I game in Indian colours. Not even two hours later, Rohit walked into the post-match press conference and told reporters that even he was biding adieu to T20I cricket.

While the players and fans are still engulfed in the high of the T20 World Cup win, the retirement of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli certainly signalled a tectonic shift in Indian cricket. They were the most experienced members of the national team and their departure paves way to an uncertain future
